The list is another data type. It's a container that holds a number of other objects in a given order.
There are a few ways we can create a list.
One way, known as a list display, is to put the items, separated by commas, in square brackets:
<br>
L = [1,2,3]
<br>
Lists can contain items of any other type, and you can even have multiple types in one list!
<br>
L2 = [22, "twenty-two", True]
<br>
