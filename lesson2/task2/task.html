When you want to put more than one variable in a print statement, you put a '+' in between them.
However we run into problems when we want to print different types in the same line. First run the program and
see what error you get.

Luckily, we can "cast" data of one type to other types using the methods int(), str(), bool() and float().
Use the str() method with integer as the input.
