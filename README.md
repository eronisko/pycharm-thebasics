For use with the Pycharm Educational Edition

I'm teaching a year 8 python class (12 - 13yr olds) and am experimenting with using Pycharm Education Edition. Students have experience programming in Scratch, but most have never used any text-based language. I'd like to see whether or not using an IDE to start with is beneficial for the students. 
Any feedback is most welcome!
